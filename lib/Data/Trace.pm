=head1 NAME

Data::Trace - Trace when a data structure gets updated.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

our $VERSION = '0.04';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

TODO

    use Data::Trace;

    my $data = {a => [0, {complex => 1}]};
    sub BadCall{ $data->{a}[0] = 1 }
    Data::Trace->Trace($data);
    BadCall();  # Shows strack trace of where data was changed.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a convienient way to find out
when a data structure has been updated.

It is a debugging/tracing aid for complex systems to identify unintentional
alteration to data structures which should be treated as read-only.

Probably can also create a variable as read-only in Moose and see where
its been changed, but this module is without Moose support.
